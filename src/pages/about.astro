    Hi there! I'm Jason Adle. I'm a transportation planner, urbanist, technology enthusiast, sysadmin-in-training, and developer-in-progress.

   <br><br>My background is primarily in geography and urban planning, through which I've gained exposure to coding and development both for direct projects and indirect/ancillary work. I also enjoy working on things and learning more in my free time.

    <p class = "mt-5">Excellent question. A very brief variant of my resume is available on the <a href="/resume" class="text-logo-green hover:text-logo-blue">Resume</a> section of this site. Some projects I've worked on throughout my career (and some personal projects) are linked in the <a href="/blog" class="text-logo-green hover:text-logo-blue" >Projects</a> section.</p>
